# Website portfolio of Iva Jelavic Aka Maoxchan

[Maoxchan Website](https://hje58raf.github.io/MS-1/)  is part of Code Institute's Milestone 1 Project: User-Centric Front-End Development module. 
It is intended for recruits and potential employers to provide an overview of my daughter skills, experiences and qualifications.

# UX

## Project goals

* Making a static front-end site to present useful information to users/ recruitments, using all technologies that I have learned about so far. (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and user experience/design)
* Creating a website that is easy to navigate and easy to understand.
* The customer experience has to be great on every device and internet browser.
* I am creating a portfolio website to show my daughter skills and creativity and competencies.
* The portfolio website is for recruiters and the animation industry, who want to know more about my daughter.

## User stories

### First time visitors

* As a first time visitor, I want the website scales on every device, so that I can look at the website on desktop, mobile and tablet.
* As a first visitor, I want to see the works so far, so I know that person’s level of experience.
* As a first time visitor, I want to know which projects the person has done, so that I know the level of experience of the person.
* As a first time visitor to the site I want the information to be clear and concise so that I can easily understand what the site is about. 
* As a first time visitor, I want to be able to find all the information that is available including be able to download a copy of the curriculum vitae and the facility to check out their social media for any other useful information.

### As a recruiter

* I want to easily check her skill set comparing it against those required by my client. The ability to download her curriculum vitae will help to speed up the recruitment process and allow me to share her details with my client. 
* I will need to have a quick and easy way to contact her if she meets the required criteria.

## Design

I've chosen 2 primary colours for the backgrounds (#fdebe4), headings and footers (#d1e3fa). I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the Maoxchan image

## Typography

The Lato and Roboto font are the main fonts used throughout the whole portfolio website. Sans Serif is the fallback in case the main font isn’t being imported to the site correctly. 

## Imagery

All images are personal images. I tried to match the colors on the website with the colors used in the Maoxchan image.

## Wireframes

# Features

## Existing Features

### Header navigation bar

My daughter personal logo is shown on the header on the left side. The navigation bar items are positioned to the left side of the screen and aligned in the centre of the bar. They give access to the Gallery, and Contact pages as well as allowing the site visitor to download my Curriculum Vitae.
With a mobile device, the navibar is displayed in a hamburger menu.

### Footer

Social media links of Facebook Instagram and Twitter.

### Home

On the home page, my daughter is presented with a picture of her and a picture of her pseudonym. I also listed her skills as an animator and character designer.
From the homepage there are links to the gallery page and contact page.

### Gallery page

The gallery page is divided into three sections: Gif, Animation and Artwork. Here are some of her works from these areas. 


### Contact page

My contact page is very simple so. There are input fields for a name, email address and a decription of what the contact is in relation to.

## Features left to implement in the future

As this project is designed to build a static front-end which demonstrates the skills I have developed using CSS3, HTML5 and Bootstrap technologies, I would like to add a page for the sale of works in the following projects. 
I would also like to allow visitors to rate the works.

Welcome hje58raf,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use.

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Make Public*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

## Updates Since The Instructional Video

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

Happy coding!
